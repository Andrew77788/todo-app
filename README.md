Technologies Used
1. Frontend
  - React – Component-based UI development.
  - React DOM – Efficient rendering of React components in the browser.
2. State Management
  - Context API (React Context) – Manages global state for the application (e.g., TodoProvider).
3. Styling & UI Frameworks
  - Bulma – CSS framework for responsive design.
  - SCSS (Sass) – Preprocessor for modular and maintainable styles.
4. Tooling & Bundling
  - TypeScript (JSX/TSX) – Provides type safety and better developer experience.
  - ES Modules (ESM) – Uses modern JavaScript module system for modular code structure.

This application is a Todo List Manager that allows users to:
  - Create, edit, and delete tasks.
  - Mark tasks as completed or pending.
  - Persist data across sessions using state management.
  - Provide a responsive and clean UI with Bulma & SCSS.
